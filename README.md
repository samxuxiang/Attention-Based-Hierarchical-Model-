# Attention Based Hierarchical RNN for Image Captioning



Use hierarchical attention from different feature layer to generate image captioning

This is the code for the final project of 10-807 at CMU

This is the code for the image captioning part

(1) Download MS COCO data, download VGG16 pretrained model [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/]
(2) Resize images to 224 x 224 Â [resize.py]

(3) Preprocess annotions and extract features [preprocess.py]

(4) Train your model [train.py]

(5) Test your model [test.py]


Have Fun :)
